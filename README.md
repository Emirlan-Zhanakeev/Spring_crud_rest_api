# Spring_crud_rest_api
## Introduction
A Spring CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) allows users to manipulate resources over HTTP. The Spring framework provides a powerful set of tools to create RESTful APIs in a quick and efficient manner.

In this type of project, developers can create endpoints to create, read, update, and delete resources. These endpoints can be consumed by any client capable of making HTTP requests, making them highly versatile and interoperable.

In a Spring CRUD REST API test project without a database, the resources are not stored in a database but are simulated using other data structures such as in-memory lists or arrays. This type of project can be used to test the functionality of the API without relying on a database, making it a useful starting point for prototyping or testing.
